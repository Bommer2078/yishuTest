    <h1>Virtual Archaeology of Electronic Orbits: A Distributed Embodied Narrative Strategy</h1>
    
    <div class="abstract">
        <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
        <p>This study explores a distributed embodied narrative strategy through the virtual reality artwork Back to the North: Virtual Archaeology of Electronic Orbits. Centered on the ironic role of railway networks in post-industrial cities of northern China, the work reconstructs an asynchronous spatiotemporal fabric that integrates collective memory by leveraging Spatio-Temporal Reconstruction of public media imagery and personal archives. These electronic islands metaphorically reflect the cyber-geopolitical dynamics latent in the post-AI era. The narrative system, structured around the Electronic Flâneur, redefines the collaborative framework of immersive storytelling by poetically constructing an optimistic archaeological vision of the future: virtual railway tracks bridge data islands, transforming them into a distributed virtual narrative space. This paper presents the artwork as a case study demonstrating this approach.</p>

        <h2>1 Introduction</h2>
        <blockquote>The flâneur's movement creates anachrony: he travels urban space, the space of modernity, but is forever looking to the past. He reverts to his memory of the city and rejects the self-enunciative authority of any technically reproduced image.<br>— Kirsten Seale [1].</blockquote>
        
        <p>The historical development of railway networks significantly reshaped the visual culture and lived experience of cities in northern China. Yet, this infrastructure also ironically witnessed and contributed to the gradual resource depletion across this vast region [2]. While connecting towns, the railway tracks simultaneously isolated them, creating divisions in both physical space-time and the emerging virtual, algorithmic realm. The experience of 19th-century railway travel itself marked a shift in modern perception, fragmenting landscapes and altering the sense of time and space [2]. Within this context, the enclosed train carriage serves as a classic metaphor for immersive narrative experiences. However, contemporary virtual reality (VR) narratives, often designed as synchronous, co-present collaborative environments, can obscure the complexities inherent in this Cyber-Railway Economic Geography—namely, the multiple, often fragmented, collective memories embedded within cultural landscapes.</p>
        
        <p>This research, therefore, seeks to establish a distributed narrative network, metaphorically represented by railway tracks, grounded in immersive XR experiences. The term Distributed Narrative, initially describing fragmented, asynchronous, cross-media storytelling [3], is adapted here. While related concepts like Participatory Sense-Making [4] and Distributed Cognition [5] highlight the co-construction of meaning in shared environments, this work focuses on the distributed construction process inherent in using fragmented spatio-temporal data to build narrative spaces. The resulting electronic data islands reference not only the immersive exploration but also the implicit cyber-geopolitical conditions emerging in the post-AI era.</p>
        
        <p>Grounded in a Design Fiction strategy, this research poetically constructs an optimistic vision of future archaeology. In the VR artwork Back to the North: Virtual Archaeology of Electronic Orbits, virtual electronic tracks connect these data islands, forming a distributed narrative space. The railway serves as the core thread, guiding users through a spatial montage where fragmented urban histories can be interactively explored. This paper addresses two key research questions:</p>
        
        <p>(1) How can a distributed narrative structure be constructed through embodied experience in virtual reality, differing from conventional immersive narratives?</p>
        
        <p>(2) How can public media images form digital scenes for common (distributed) memories, and how does the Electronic Flâneur's wandering facilitate narrative exploration?</p>
